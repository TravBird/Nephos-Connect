Nephos-Connect is an Electron-Based application designed primarily to work alongside the NephOS Operating System. 
# What is Nephos?
Nephos is a project to investigate the idea of **SyaaS**, System as a Service, a new form of Cloud Computing.
SyaaS intends to bring Thin Clients and Virtual Desktops to a wider audience, away from just Organisations by allowing the seamless streaming of one or more Virtual Machines (Systems) to the user, as if they had a desktop in front of them. A user will interact with SyaaS via a thin client, in the case of Nephos- this is the Nephos Device and Nephos-Connect. 

Note: due to the early development of this project- which is academic in form- NephOS is only availible to a small group of users. 

Nephos-Connect has several Key Features
* Authentication with Nephos using 3 Legged OAuth with Oracle IDCS 
* Register for a Nephos account from within the application
* Connect to Wireless Networks nearby (a feature intended to be used primarily with NephOS)
* Creation of User Systems (Cloud-Based Virtual Machines in OCI)
* Viewing of User Systems
* Connection to User Systems by passing information to local RDP or VNC installation
* Deletion of User Systems
